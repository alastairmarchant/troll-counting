# Troll Counting
## Introduction
In Terry Pratchett's Discworld series, trolls are essentially living rocks. Many assume trolls are illiterate or innumerate, but that actually [have their own numerical system](https://discworld.fandom.com/wiki/Troll#Literacy_and_Numeracy).<br />
This is a small react app to convert from out base ten system, to the Troll numerical system.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.<br />

These tests are to check that the main components render, and that a few test numbers display correctly.
